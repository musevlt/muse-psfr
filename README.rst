WFM-AO PSF reconstruction from SPARTA
=====================================

This repository contains a code which allows to reconstruct a PSF for the WFM-AO
mode, using telemetry data from SPARTA.

Original code was written in IDL by Thierry Fusco <thierry.fusco@onera.fr> (and
other people ?).

Code was ported to Python by Simon Conseil <simon.conseil@univ-lyon1.fr>.
